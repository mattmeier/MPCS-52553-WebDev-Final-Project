# MPCS-52553-WebDev-Final-Project
Final Project for the MPCS 52553 Web Development class at the University of Chicago in Spring 2015. My project partner is Alex Tsu (alextsu).

Please note that the project is obviously still work-in-progress and many aspects still need to be implemented or fixed, including signup/login/logout, proper cookie functionality, event attendance and friendlist functionality, color and date pickers etc.
